Reading The Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison, Claudia’s identity as a young black girl shapes her experiences of society and authority into moments of confusion and resentment at the world. One example of this is her hatred of Shirley Temple. To Claudia, receiving a Shirley Temple doll meant an expectation of motherhood and the fact that “blue-eyed, yellow-haired, pink-skinned” was supposed to be “what every girl child treasured” (pg. 20). Both clash directly against her own individual idea of what it means to be a girl. She does not understand why typically “white” features are the beauty standard, and that is where Shirley Temple conflicts with Claudia’s racial identity as well. Confused, Claudia was searching for inner beauty by looking inside the doll (pg. 21). Society (including other black people like her parents, Frieda, and Pecola, who all consider the doll beautiful, p. 19-21), has defined something unattainable for black girls like Claudia, which is initially nonsensical and frustrating. Later, it drives how she sees society, even after “learning” her impossible expectations (pg. 23)—with a “hatred for all the Shirley Temples of the world” (pg. 19).
 The differences between Pecola and Rosemary due to their race are highlighted by their shared gender identity. Pecola hides behind her ugliness, “concealed, veiled, eclipsed—peeping out from behind the shroud very seldom, and then only to yearn for the return of her mask” (39). Unlike her brother who can run away, she is trapped due to her gender (43) and hides. “Concealing” herself serves to prevent others from looking at her; she is the one being watched. When she looks out, she immediately goes back into hiding to conceal herself once again. Ugliness for Pecola she “accepted” from an “all-knowing master” (39), connoting it with beauty standards created by white oppressors. Rosemary, on the other hand, feels free to look upon and be looked upon by the black characters of the book. When she sees Frieda and Claudia, she rolls down the window, her “mask” (which is transparent anyway), to taunt them (9). Rosemary is also limited by her gender in that she can’t gain power over black girls from her looks; Claudia sees her white face watching them and scratches her (30). Yet she only “jumps back” and then begins “hollering” for Mrs. MacTeer’s attention, and she does not run away or hide. Rosemary being a white girl affords her a unique position with no real authority but no fear or shame either in front of her black counterparts, while Pecola has chosen to hide behind her own internally-racist view of black femininity.
   One scene I think was very successful in inspiring empathy was the scene where Khalil and Starr were pulled over. If the scene were presented as plain plot/actions/events, I would not be able to empathize (but I could sympathize) with the characters because I cannot relate to this event in any way. However, the director’s use of the affordances of film abstract this scene into more universal experiences, such as fear and shock for a loved one, which evoke empathy in a wider audience, more than a pure police encounter. Starr’s fear is evident through her delivery at 25:30; she is suddenly forceful in her tone of voice, showing care and fear for Khalil for not doing what she considers common sense. This expands the scene from fear of the police to fear of the consequences of a loved one being reckless. The continuation of the music in the background adds to Khalil’s indifference and highlights Starr’s worries. When it disappears, each character’s mood comes the forefront and clashes with the others. The limited and bouncy camera movement from inside the car shows her helplessness as a viewer and provides  the audience the same perspective. When it rushes to turn toward the police officer, it creates a sense of sudden shock, while the absence of music adds to the shock of the sound of bullets and a lone scream. These techniques are only possible in film and successfully inspire empathy in the audience.
      I interpret “Family Ties Unlaced” (63) to be about the disconnect between Black Americans in the present, even though people usually focus on the connection between African American culture and African culture. This idea fits into one of the themes of the collection: the historic struggles of being Black in America that still linger today. The main use of repetition in this poem is when “My distant kin / from across the water” shifts to “My distant kin / from across the counter.” The phrase initially shows the narrator’s interest in connecting with their African heritage, but after the observations of the next stanza, it shows their disconnect to other African Americans. The repetition emphasizes that; the first phrase’s meaning is clear enough and the second phrase pushes the reader to understand the modern version of the issue through the same lens as the first. Without the repetition, it may have been hard to see the “distance” across a counter. With it, we understand the weight of the scene.
        On pages 172-173 of March: Book Two, we see a full bleed spreading two pages showing Dr. King passionately delivering his famous “I Have a Dream” speech. Most of the space is pure black, except for two bursts of light—one surrounding Dr. King himself and the other from the top-left corner. Coming from the previous pages crowded with light, small panels and text bubbles, this visual feels a lot more open and lets the reader take in the importance of this massive scene. The spacing also makes is slower to read, and therefore somewhat more impactful. It also allows the artists room to play with the darkness and light in a way that gives the impression of almost a holy moment in history. Without panels, every block of text feels a bit placeless and timeless, adding to the significance of this speech to history. Everything is allowed to float in this magical, holy void and hold its own weight, except the only word we need in order to understand the significance of the scene and take the rest of the page in: “dream.”
        I definitely agree with your analysis of this scene, especially regarding the intersection of Claudia's identities as black and female. Her age is also another important factor, as you discuss, but I think Claudia being a child serves to show us the perspective of a character who hasn't fully accepted/understood the realities of being black/female, rather than some sort of commentary or greater point, like with race and gender. This is supported by Claudia's resistance to racial/gender hierarchy through "childish" fighting, which is in contrast to her mother, who was quick to believe a white person and punish her own children for "playing nasty."
        I agree that Pecola faces this treatment because she is a black girl. I would also like to point out why I think Pecola faces worse bullying than Claudia or Frieda, which is her "ugliness." Repeated physical descriptions of her and her family show that she is somehow "blacker" than others, and therefore also less beautiful, which brings her down both in terms of race and gender. I think this is important because it shows the consequences of expectations and stereotypes belonging to an identity, not just having the identity.
        I agree. The most interesting example of this to me is when Pecola gets blue eyes from Soaphead Church. She doesn't have literal blue eyes, but she still believes she has them (in some sense) and that she is beautiful, showing how beauty is defined by one's self-image, not what others decide. Along those lines, however, Pecola still compares her eyes to others, who may or may not have bluer eyes, and plays into the white beauty standard again, which ruins her own beauty for her.
        I don't agree that having fancier clothes or acting "better" would make Pecola beautiful; I don't think Morrison emphasizes that Pecola has bad behavior or is dressed in rags. I think clothes and actions (more how you carry yourself than specific actions) have an association with race, class, and a general hierarchy. Pecola's fear and timidness puts her on the bottom, and if she was more confident and believed in her own beauty, I believe she would be perceived as more beautiful.
        I agree with your interpretation. I also think that the difference in line length this enjambment creates adds a rhythm that reinforces the feeling of shakiness you describe. It also shows Samaria Rice's difficulty in living without her son; the reader would likely read "Can't live" slower than the longer lines after each occurrence, like life feels drawn out for her but she doesn't want to remember the tragedy at the "gory field."
I think "suffocation" is a good word to describe how the enjambment reads. Another way it could be described is "fractured," which is even used in the second line. Either way, this poem effectively show the pain and helplessness of Black Americans, like you describe, and the feeling of suffocation and fracture that adds a nuance to that pain that I believe would be hard to describe concisely in words.
I agree with you on how you describe the contrast of this page contributing to theme of the memoir, and I especially like you point about how this contrast is unique to visual media. However, I think it is also important to note that in this case, it is actually a combination of visual and written media (though the text is also somewhat visual in how it is displayed). I think juxtaposing imagery with text emphasizes the contrast you observed even further--what you "hear" is what's written, and the reality is what you see in front of you. And when the contrast disappears when the hopeful text is displayed in front of the inauguration, the growth of America becomes clear.
I agree with your analysis of what that scene means, but I think that in addition to contrast between text and image, this page uses the contrast and similarity of the image and visual aspect of the text. Specifically, the artist matches/contrasts the visual weight of the text with the visual weight of the image. The police chief and his excuses have a light weight, showing his ambivalence and the lack of gravity in his words. Images of the attack and the reveal of the police chief's true motives are dark and heavy, showing the truth is much more grave than the police chief lets on.
