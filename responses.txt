Reading The Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison, Claudia’s identity as a young black girl shapes her experiences of society and authority into moments of confusion and resentment at the world. One example of this is her hatred of Shirley Temple. To Claudia, receiving a Shirley Temple doll meant an expectation of motherhood and the fact that “blue-eyed, yellow-haired, pink-skinned” was supposed to be “what every girl child treasured” (pg. 20). Both clash directly against her own individual idea of what it means to be a girl. She does not understand why typically “white” features are the beauty standard, and that is where Shirley Temple conflicts with Claudia’s racial identity as well. Confused, Claudia was searching for inner beauty by looking inside the doll (pg. 21). Society (including other black people like her parents, Frieda, and Pecola, who all consider the doll beautiful, p. 19-21), has defined something unattainable for black girls like Claudia, which is initially nonsensical and frustrating. Later, it drives how she sees society, even after “learning” her impossible expectations (pg. 23)—with a “hatred for all the Shirley Temples of the world” (pg. 19).
The differences between Pecola and Rosemary due to their race are highlighted by their shared gender identity. Pecola hides behind her ugliness, “concealed, veiled, eclipsed—peeping out from behind the shroud very seldom, and then only to yearn for the return of her mask” (39). Unlike her brother who can run away, she is trapped due to her gender (43) and hides. “Concealing” herself serves to prevent others from looking at her; she is the one being watched. When she looks out, she immediately goes back into hiding to conceal herself once again. Ugliness for Pecola she “accepted” from an “all-knowing master” (39), connoting it with beauty standards created by white oppressors. Rosemary, on the other hand, feels free to look upon and be looked upon by the black characters of the book. When she sees Frieda and Claudia, she rolls down the window, her “mask” (which is transparent anyway), to taunt them (9). Rosemary is also limited by her gender in that she can’t gain power over black girls from her looks; Claudia sees her white face watching them and scratches her (30). Yet she only “jumps back” and then begins “hollering” for Mrs. MacTeer’s attention, and she does not run away or hide. Rosemary being a white girl affords her a unique position with no real authority but no fear or shame either in front of her black counterparts, while Pecola has chosen to hide behind her own internally-racist view of black femininity.
I interpret “Family Ties Unlaced” (63) to be about the disconnect between Black Americans in the present, even though people usually focus on the connection between African American culture and African culture. This idea fits into one of the themes of the collection: the historic struggles of being Black in America that still linger today. The main use of repetition in this poem is when “My distant kin / from across the water” shifts to “My distant kin / from across the counter.” The phrase initially shows the narrator’s interest in connecting with their African heritage, but after the observations of the next stanza, it shows their disconnect to other African Americans. The repetition emphasizes that; the first phrase’s meaning is clear enough and the second phrase pushes the reader to understand the modern version of the issue through the same lens as the first. Without the repetition, it may have been hard to see the “distance” across a counter. With it, we understand the weight of the scene.
I definitely agree with your analysis of this scene, especially regarding the intersection of Claudia's identities as black and female. Her age is also another important factor, as you discuss, but I think Claudia being a child serves to show us the perspective of a character who hasn't fully accepted/understood the realities of being black/female, rather than some sort of commentary or greater point, like with race and gender. This is supported by Claudia's resistance to racial/gender hierarchy through "childish" fighting, which is in contrast to her mother, who was quick to believe a white person and punish her own children for "playing nasty."
I agree that Pecola faces this treatment because she is a black girl. I would also like to point out why I think Pecola faces worse bullying than Claudia or Frieda, which is her "ugliness." Repeated physical descriptions of her and her family show that she is somehow "blacker" than others, and therefore also less beautiful, which brings her down both in terms of race and gender. I think this is important because it shows the consequences of expectations and stereotypes belonging to an identity, not just having the identity.
I agree. The most interesting example of this to me is when Pecola gets blue eyes from Soaphead Church. She doesn't have literal blue eyes, but she still believes she has them (in some sense) and that she is beautiful, showing how beauty is defined by one's self-image, not what others decide. Along those lines, however, Pecola still compares her eyes to others, who may or may not have bluer eyes, and plays into the white beauty standard again, which ruins her own beauty for her.
I don't agree that having fancier clothes or acting "better" would make Pecola beautiful; I don't think Morrison emphasizes that Pecola has bad behavior or is dressed in rags. I think clothes and actions (more how you carry yourself than specific actions) have an association with race, class, and a general hierarchy. Pecola's fear and timidness puts her on the bottom, and if she was more confident and believed in her own beauty, I believe she would be perceived as more beautiful.
I agree with your interpretation. I also think that the difference in line length this enjambment creates adds a rhythm that reinforces the feeling of shakiness you describe. It also shows Samaria Rice's difficulty in living without her son; the reader would likely read "Can't live" slower than the longer lines after each occurrence, like life feels drawn out for her but she doesn't want to remember the tragedy at the "gory field."
I think "suffocation" is a good word to describe how the enjambment reads. Another way it could be described is "fractured," which is even used in the second line. Either way, this poem effectively show the pain and helplessness of Black Americans, like you describe, and the feeling of suffocation and fracture that adds a nuance to that pain that I believe would be hard to describe concisely in words.
